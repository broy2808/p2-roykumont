no Linux-specific functions needed...? besides tar-ing the directory
(github push test)

====================

first character on first line is total # of processes

go through entire file first and store process data into appropriate data structures (arrival time, burst time, etc.)

then call separate function to actually process the data that we've stored into the data structures

single function for checking for process arrivals and process completions (t = <...>)
	- process completions are processed before arrivals
	- when this happens, print memory map

====================

output(), MMDisplay()

====================

tentative schedule:

complete code before 5/10
complete documentation 5/18
