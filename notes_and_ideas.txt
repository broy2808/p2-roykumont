no Linux-specific functions needed...? besides tar-ing the directory

first character on first line is total # of processes

when process completes (i.e. t=1000 in out1.txt), the frames used by that process are freed (i.e. 0-399)

when new processes are added, they try to use the earliest available memory

data we need to keep track of:
1. time each process enters queue
2. burst time of each process
3. memory pieces for each process
4. average turnaround time
